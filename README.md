> **TL;DR**: CNB grants verified orgs **500 ~ 1,166 AI Credits** and **1,600 compute core-hours** monthly for free. Combined with CNB's 30x prompt caching discount, you can enjoy **up to ~200 Million DeepSeek Tokens per month for free**! However, the AI completion endpoint is strictly locked inside the workspace intranet with ephemeral pipeline tokens, while containers are recycled daily. **cnb2api** runs inside the workspace, converts it into a standard public API with zero dependencies, and leverages a **v5.2 dual-watchdog self-healing architecture** to deliver permanent domain access and 7×24 HA.

### Key Features

- 💰 **Up to 200M Free DeepSeek Tokens Monthly**:
  - Fully unleashes the 500~1,166 monthly AI Credits provided for free by CNB.
  - Native **30x Prompt Cache discount** on upstream completions. In typical coding assistant, Claude Code, and multi-turn Agent scenarios with high prompt reuse, effective capacity reaches **~200M tokens/month**.
- ⚡ **Native Dual-Protocol Support**:
  - **OpenAI Compatible**: `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models`, supporting SSE streaming and faithful non-streaming aggregation (reconstructing `usage`, exact `credit` costs, incremental `tool_calls`, and `finish_reason`).
  - **Anthropic Compatible**: `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, enabling **Claude Code CLI direct connection** with full support for thinking blocks, tool calling, and event streams.
  - 🛡️ **Outbound Neutralizer**: Transparently rewrites Claude Code internal billing headers and signature prompt phrases, eliminating false-positive 11128 upstream blocks without altering semantics.
- ♻️ **v5.2 Zero Long-Lived Credentials + Self-Healing HA**:
  - **Zero Token Leakage**: No static long-lived platform tokens in the workspace. The self-healing cron pipeline uses ephemeral platform `CNB_TOKEN`s minted on demand and destroyed on completion.
  - **Dynamic Routing Follower**: On boot, `start.sh` registers the new dynamic subdomain to your relay (`/ops/register`), which hot-reloads nginx upstream configurations. Client URLs and keys stay permanent. Full recovery takes **~2m 13s**.
  - **Dormancy Watchdog**: Circumvents CI platform cron dormancy (CNB pauses crons if no commits occur over multiple days). An external watchdog (`cnb-watchdog.sh`) detects stalled states and silently triggers fallback OpenAPI starts with cooldown protection.
- 🪶 **True Zero Dependencies**: 100% built on Node.js 22+ native primitives (`fetch`, `ReadableStream`, `crypto.timingSafeEqual`, `node:test`). Zero `npm install`, instant cold starts.
- 📊 **Monitoring & Quota Dashboard**:
  - `cnb2api-quota` CLI: One-command ANSI progress bar dashboard showing AI credits, dev core-hours, CI core-hours, and in-flight amounts directly from the official charge API. Supports `--json` and `--line`.
  - In-memory `GET /usage` accounting endpoint grouped by boot generation with UTC+8 daily rollups.

## How It Works

```
Client (OpenAI Client / Claude Code / API Gateway)
  │  https://ai.example.com/v1 (Fixed domain, self-hosted Nginx relay)
  ▼
https://<dynamic-subdomain>-9001.cnb.run (CNB port-proxy, auto-synced via /ops/register on boot)
  │
  ▼
node src/server.mjs (Workspace port 9001, cnb2api reverse proxy)
  │  Bearer CNB_TOKEN (Auto-minted by CNB pipeline, internal network)
  ▼
https://api.cnb.cool/<org>/<repo>/-/ai/chat/completions (Official AI core endpoint)
```

The workspace is treated as **cattle, not a pet**:
1. **Cron Recovery**: An internal cron pipeline (`*/5 * * * *`) checks workspace health and calls `workspace/start` if stopped.
2. **Auto-Registration**: On boot, `deploy/start.sh` POSTs the newly assigned subdomain to `/ops/register` on your relay, which reloads Nginx.
3. **External Fallback**: An external VPS watchdog (`cnb-watchdog.sh`) monitors the fixed domain to guard against CI platform cron dormancy.

## Quickstart

Three simple steps, only one API key to configure:

1. **Fork Private**: Fork this repository as a **private repo** on CNB.
2. **Configure API Key**: In `.cnb.yml`, set your custom `PROXY_KEY` in the `env:` block (e.g. `openssl rand -hex 24`).
3. **Launch Cloud Workspace**: Click "Start Cloud Development" on CNB. The build log prints `PROXY_URI=https://<subdomain>-9001.cnb.run` — ready to use!

> 💡 Need a permanent domain? Set up a simple Nginx reverse proxy on your VPS with `/ops/register`. See the [Full Setup Guide (docs/SETUP.md)](docs/SETUP.md).

## Client Integration Examples

### 1. Claude Code Direct Connect (Anthropic Protocol)
```bash
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://ai.example.com \
ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-proxy-key \
ANTHROPIC_MODEL=deepseek-v4-flash \
claude -p "Hello! Introduce yourself."
```

### 2. OpenAI Clients & Gateways
Point BaseURL to `https://ai.example.com/v1` and set API Key to `PROXY_KEY`:
- **Chat Apps**: NextChat, LobeChat, Cherry Studio, Open WebUI
- **Gateways**: New API, One API (Channel type: OpenAI, model: `deepseek-v4-flash`)
- **Coding Agents**: Cursor, Continue, Codex CLI

### 3. curl Verification
```bash
curl https://ai.example.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-proxy-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"stream":false}'
```

## Quota & Cost Estimates: How to Get 200M Tokens Free Monthly

Real production billing data measured over months of live operation (not marketing hype):

| Resource Allowance | Free Monthly Quota | Cost & Capacity Notes |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **AI Credits** | Base **500**, up to **1,166** after *hello-cnb* quest | Every response reports exact `credit` in `usage`. Combined with Prompt Cache, delivers **~200M DeepSeek Tokens/month**. |
| **Compute Core-Hours** | **1,600 core-hours** (shared dev + CI pool) | A `runner.cpus: 2` workspace running 24/7 for 30 days costs **1,440 core-hours** (safely within the 1,600 pool). No need to stop the proxy. |

> 💡 **The Math Behind 200M Free Tokens/Month**:
> 1. **Base Upstream Rate**: Live measurements on `deepseek-v4-flash` show an uncached 9,000-token request costs ~0.39 credit (approx **23,000 tokens / credit**).
> 2. **Official Prompt Cache 30x Discount**: Once prompt prefixes hit CNB's prompt cache, cost drops to **~0.01 credit**, slashing cost to **1/30** of base price (~**700,000 tokens / credit**).
> 3. **Real-World Scenarios**: In coding assistants, Claude Code, and multi-turn Agent conversations with long system prompts and history reuse, cache hit rates typically sit at 80%~95% (assuming a realistic **90% cache hit rate**):
>    $$\text{Blended Cost} = 10\% \times 1 + 90\% \times \frac{1}{30} \approx 13\% \text{ base cost} \implies \approx 177,000\text{ tokens / credit}$$
>    $$\text{Monthly Total} = 1,166\text{ credits} \times 177,000\text{ tokens} \approx \mathbf{206\text{ Million tokens / month}}$$
> 4. Run `npm run quota` anytime in your terminal to inspect your live remaining credits and consumption.

## FAQ

**Q: Why does the model list include glm and kimi when the backend is DeepSeek?**  
A: The official CNB AI gateway currently routes all models to `deepseek-v4-flash`. Exposing multiple aliases ensures compatibility with various client presets out of the box.

**Q: Are native Tool Calls / Function Calling supported?**  
A: Fully supported. In streaming mode, `input_json_delta` chunks are cleanly combined; in non-streaming mode, standard `tool_calls` structures are reassembled.

**Q: Does this violate CNB Terms of Service?**  
A: No. It runs inside your own authorized workspace, calls official documented endpoints, uses platform-minted tokens, and consumes your own allocated quota. No reverse-engineered frontend endpoints or anonymous scraping.
